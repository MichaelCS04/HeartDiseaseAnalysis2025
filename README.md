# HeartDiseaseAnalysis2025
This project explores clinical data to understand the factors associated with heart disease and to build a predictive model using machine learning. Our goal is to identify key indicators such as fasting blood sugar, excercise angina, and old peak that contribute to heart diseasse risk.

# Dataset:
"Heart Failure Prediction Dataset" - sourced from Kaggle, contains patient health metrics such as age, sex, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, chest pain type, and more.

# Objective:
Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on various health indicators.

# Preprocessing:

- Handling missing values

- Encoding categorical variables

- Normalizing numerical data

# Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Visualizing distributions of key features

- Investigating relationships (e.g., cholesterol vs. heart disease)

- Correlation heatmap

# Modeling:

- Logistic Regression

- Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
